Q. 4.2.4 Describe what happens if you apply binary search to an unordered array.
Why shouldn't you check whether the array is sorted before each call to binary search?
Could you check that the elements binary search examines are in ascending order? 
If so, would that check be effective?

A. Binary search does not work. The algorithm will take the mid element but 
it will choose the upper or lower half of the array base on random value, 
hence the selection of a half and the posibility of getting a macht (if any) 
work base on randoness. It is not possible to use or implement Binary Search 
on unsorted arrays or lists, because, the repeated targeting of the mid element
of one half depends on the sorted order of data structure.

Checking if the array is already sorted is necessary to ensure that the binary 
search will work properly; the best way to do this is linearly checking the 
array and compare if each value is lower than the next one.

Also doing a sorting before the binary search will do the job.
